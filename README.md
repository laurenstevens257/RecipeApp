## Description

Welcome to GoodEats, our recipe sharing app! GoodEats allows users to conveniently create and save recipes so they can come back to them later. It also allows users to discover othersâ€™ recipes and save them to a collection of liked recipes (FLAVORites). Additional utilities are included, such as the option to add the necessary ingredients for a recipe to the grocery list, and a measurement converter (e.g. from tablespoons to teaspoons).

## Now, to run the project.

Open up a split terminal.
From the root directory, in the first one do:
$ cd server
$ node server.js

In the second one, do:
$ cd client
$ npm start
